== About This Guide

This Quick Start reference deployment guide discusses architectural
considerations and configuration steps for deploying a modular Amazon
Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) environment on the Amazon Web
Services (AWS) Cloud. It also provides links for viewing and launching
http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation] templates that
automate the deployment.

The guide is for IT infrastructure architects, DevOps engineers, and
administrators who would like to build a flexible, modular AWS
networking infrastructure as a baseline for their deployments.

http://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/[Quick Starts] are automated reference
deployments for AWS Cloud infrastructure components and key enterprise
workloads on the AWS Cloud. Each Quick Start launches, configures, and
runs AWS compute, network, storage, and other services, using AWS best
practices for security and availability.

== Overview

This Quick Start provides a networking foundation for AWS Cloud
infrastructures. It deploys an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
according to AWS best practices and guidelines. Amazon VPC is the
networking layer for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and
provides a private, isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can
launch AWS services and other resources in a virtual network. For a
discussion of best design practices for Amazon VPC environments, see the
documentation and articles listed in the
link:#additional-resources[Additional Resources] section.

The Amazon VPC architecture includes public and private subnets. The
first set of private subnets share the default network access control
list (ACL) from the Amazon VPC, and a second, optional set of private
subnets includes dedicated custom network ACLs per subnet. The Quick
Start divides the Amazon VPC address space in a predictable manner
across multiple Availability Zones, and deploys either NAT instances or
NAT gateways for outbound Internet access, depending on the AWS Region
you deploy the Quick Start in.

You can use this Quick Start as a building block for your own
deployments. You can scale it up or down by adding or removing subnets
and Availability Zones according to your needs, and add other
infrastructure components and software layers to complete your AWS
environment.

=== Quick Links

The links in this section are for your convenience. Before you launch
the Quick Start, please review the architecture, configuration, and
other considerations discussed in this guide.

* If you have an AWS account and you’re already familiar with AWS
services, you can https://fwd.aws/mm853[launch the Quick Start] to build
the architecture shown in link:#figure1[Figure 1] in your AWS account.
The deployment takes approximately 5 minutes. If you’re new to AWS,
please follow the link:#subnet-sizing[step-by-step instructions]
provided later in this guide.
* If you want to take a look under the covers, you can
https://fwd.aws/px53q[view the AWS CloudFormation template] that
automates the deployment. The template includes default settings that
you can customize by following the instructions in this guide.

=== Cost 

You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running
this Quick Start reference deployment. There is no additional cost for
using the Quick Start.

The AWS CloudFormation template for this Quick Start includes
configuration parameters that you can customize. Some of the settings,
such as the instance type, number of Availability Zones, use of NAT
gateways or NAT instances (depending on the AWS Region you choose), and
amount of data that flows through the NAT device, will determine the
cost of deployment. To get an estimate, you can use the
http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html[AWS Simple Monthly
Calculator].

For pricing details, see the https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/[Amazon
EC2 pricing] and https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/[Amazon VPC pricing]
pages.

== Architecture

Deploying this Quick Start with the *default parameters* builds the
following virtual networking environment in the AWS Cloud.

image::architecture.png[Architecture,640,480]

* Note that the IP addresses exclude five addresses from each subnet
that are reserved and unavailable for use.

Figure 1: Modular Amazon VPC architecture on AWS
(https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quickstart/latest/vpc/images/quickstart-vpc-design-fullscreen.png[full-screen view])

The AWS CloudFormation template sets up the virtual network and creates
networking resources.

The template creates a Multi-AZ, multi-subnet VPC infrastructure with
managed NAT gateways in the public subnet for each Availability Zone.
You can also create additional private subnets with dedicated custom
network access control lists (ACLs). If you deploy the Quick Start in a
region that doesn’t support NAT gateways, NAT instances are deployed
instead. Default subnet sizes are based on a typical deployment but can
be reconfigured, as discussed in the link:#subnet-sizing[Subnet Sizing]
section.

The Quick Start also includes VPC endpoints, which provide a secure,
reliable connection to Amazon S3 without requiring an Internet gateway,
a NAT device, or a virtual private gateway. With these endpoints, you
can access S3 resources from within the VPC created by the Quick Start.
These endpoints are valid only for the AWS Region in which you launch
the Quick Start.

The Quick Start uses the default endpoint policy, which gives any user
or service within the VPC full access to Amazon S3 resources. This
policy supplements any IAM user policies or S3 bucket policies that you
may have in place.

The Quick Start also enables Domain Name System (DNS) resolution in the
VPC. For more information about VPC endpoints, see the
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-endpoints-s3.html[AWS
documentation].

=== AWS Services

The core AWS components used by this Quick Start include the following
AWS services. (If you are new to AWS, see the
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/awsgsg-intro/intro.html[Getting
Started section] of the AWS documentation.)

* http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/vpc/[Amazon VPC] – The Amazon
Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) service lets you provision a private,
isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS services and
other resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete
control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of
an IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route
tables and network gateways.
* http://aws.amazon.com/documentation/ec2/[Amazon EC2] – The Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) service enables you to launch virtual
machine instances with a variety of operating systems. You can choose
from existing Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) or import your own virtual
machine images.
* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AmazonEBS.html[Amazon
EBS] – Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides persistent
block-level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS
Cloud. Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its
Availability Zone to protect you from component failure, offering high
availability and durability. Amazon EBS volumes provide consistent and
low-latency performance to run your workloads.
* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT
Gateway] – NAT gateways are network address translation (NAT) devices,
which provide outbound Internet access to instances in a private
subnets, but prevent the Internet from accessing those instances. NAT
gateways provide better availability and bandwidth than NAT instances.
The NAT Gateway service is a managed service that takes care of
administering NAT gateways for you. NAT gateways aren’t supported in all
AWS Regions. This Quick Start deploys NAT instances in regions where NAT
gateways aren’t available.

=== Best Practices

The architecture built by this Quick Start supports AWS best practices
for high availability and security. The Quick Start provides:

* Up to four Availability Zones for high availability and disaster
recovery. (AWS recommends maximizing your use of Availability Zones to
isolate a data center outage.) Availability Zones are geographically
distributed within a region and spaced for best insulation and stability
in the event of a natural disaster.
* Separate subnets for unique routing requirements. AWS recommends using
public subnets for external-facing resources and private subnets for
internal resources. For each Availability Zone, this Quick Start
provisions one public subnet and one private subnet by default. (If you
need public subnets only, you can disable the creation of the private
subnets.) For subnet sizing strategies, see the next section.
* Additional layer of security. AWS recommends using network ACLs as
firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
This Quick Start provides an option to create a network ACL protected
subnet in each Availability Zone. These network ACLs provide individual
controls that you can customize as a second layer of defense.

We recommend that you use network ACLs sparingly for the following
reasons: they can be complex to manage, they are stateless, every IP
address must be explicitly opened in each (inbound/outbound) direction,
and they affect a complete subnet. We recommend that you use security
groups more often than network ACLs, and create and apply these based on
a schema that works for your organization. Some examples are server
roles and application roles. For more information about security groups
and network ACLs, see the link:#security[Security] section later in this
guide.

* Independent route tables configured for every private subnet to
control the flow of traffic within and outside the Amazon VPC. The
public subnets share a single routing table, because they all use the
same Internet gateway as the sole route to communicate with the
Internet.
* Highly available NAT gateways, where supported, instead of NAT
instances. NAT gateways offer major advantages in terms of deployment,
availability, and maintenance. For more information see the
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-comparison.html[comparison]
provided in the Amazon VPC documentation.
* Spare capacity for additional subnets, to support your environment as
it grows or changes over time.

For additional information about these best practices, see the following
documentation:

ACLs] in the Amazon VPC documentation

=== Subnet Sizing

In this Quick Start, the sizing of CIDR blocks used in the subnets is
based on a typical deployment, where private subnets would have roughly
double the number of instances found in public subnets. However, during
deployment, you can use the CIDR block parameters to resize the CIDR
scopes to meet your architectural needs.

In the default subnet allocation, the VPC is divided into subnet types
and then further segmented per Availability Zone, as illustrated in
link:#figure1[Figure 1]. The Quick Start provides the following default
CIDR block sizes to maximize capacity:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|VPC |10.0.0.0/16 |
|Private subnets A |*10.0.0.0/17* |
| |Availability Zone 1 |10.0.0.0/19
| |Availability Zone 2 |10.0.32.0/19
| |Availability Zone 3 |10.0.64.0/19
| |Availability Zone 4 |10.0.96.0/19
|Public subnets |*10.0.128.0/18* |
| |Availability Zone 1 |10.0.128.0/20
| |Availability Zone 2 |10.0.144.0/20
| |Availability Zone 3 |10.0.160.0/20
| |Availability Zone 4 |10.0.176.0/20
|Private subnets B with dedicated custom network ACL |*10.0.192.0/19* |
| |Availability Zone 1 |10.0.192.0/21
| |Availability Zone 2 |10.0.200.0/21
| |Availability Zone 3 |10.0.208.0/21
| |Availability Zone 4 |10.0.216.0/21
|Spare subnet capacity |*10.0.224.0/19* |
| |Availability Zone 1 |10.0.224.0/21
| |Availability Zone 2 |10.0.232.0/21
| |Availability Zone 3 |10.0.240.0/21
| |Availability Zone 4 |10.0.248.0/21
|===

Alternatively, there may be situations where you would want to separate
the CIDR scopes by dividing the VPC into Availability Zones and then
into subnet types. The recommended CIDR blocks to maximize capacity for
this scenario are as follows:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|VPC |10.0.0.0/16 |
|Availability Zone 1 |*10.0.0.0/18* |
| |Private subnet A |10.0.0.0/19
| |Public subnet |10.0.32.0/20
| |Private subnet B |10.0.48.0/21
| |Spare subnet capacity |10.0.56.0/21
|Availibility Zone 2 |*10.0.64.0/18* |
| |Private subnet A |10.0.64.0/19
| |Public subnet |10.0.96.0/20
| |Private subnet B |10.0.112.0/21
| |Spare subnet capacity |10.0.120.0/21
|Availability Zone 3 |*10.0.128.0/18* |
| |Private subnet A |10.0.128.0/19
| |Public subnet |10.0.160.0/20
| |Private subnet B |10.0.176.0/21
| |Spare subnet capacity |10.0.184.0/21
|Availability Zone 4 |*10.0.192.0/18* |
| |Private subnet A |10.0.192.0/19
| |Public subnet |10.0.224.0/20
| |Private subnet B |10.0.240.0/21
| |Spare subnet capacity |10.0.248.0/21
|===

To customize the CIDR ranges for this scenario or to implement your own
segmentation strategy, you can configure the Quick Start parameters
described in link:#step-2.-launch-the-stack[step 2]. For more
information about VPC and subnet sizing, see the
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html#VPC_Sizing[AWS
documentation].

== Deployment Steps

Follow the step-by-step instructions in this section to build the
virtual network environment illustrated in link:#figure1[Figure 1] in
your AWS account. The AWS CloudFormation template provided with this
Quick Start bootstraps the AWS networking infrastructure on the AWS
Cloud from scratch.

=== Step 1. Prepare an AWS Account

[arabic]
. If you don’t already have an AWS account, create one at
https://aws.amazon.com by following the on-screen instructions. Part of
the sign-up process involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN
using the phone keypad.
. Use the region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region
where you want to deploy the Quick Start on AWS.

image:media/image3.png[image,width=138,height=282]

Figure 2: Choosing an AWS Region

*Tip* Consider choosing a region closest to your data center or
corporate network to reduce network latency between systems running on
AWS and the systems and users on your corporate network.

Also, note that your choice of region will determine whether the Quick
Start deploys NAT gateways or NAT instances for network connections. For
a list of regions that support NAT gateways, see
http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/[Amazon VPC pricing].

[arabic, start=3]
. Create a
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[key
pair] in your preferred region. To do this, in the navigation pane of
the Amazon EC2 console, choose *Key Pairs*, *Create Key Pair*, type a
name, and then choose *Create*.

image:media/image4.png[image,width=634,height=307]

Figure 3: Creating a key pair

Amazon EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login
information. To be able to log in to your instances, you must create a
key pair. With Windows instances, we use the key pair to obtain the
administrator password via the Amazon EC2 console and then log in using
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as explained in the
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair[step-by-step
instructions] in the _Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide_. On
Linux, we use the key pair to authenticate SSH login.

=== Step 2. Launch the Stack

[arabic]
. https://fwd.aws/mm853[Launch the Quick Start] into your AWS account.

The template is launched in the US West (Oregon) region by default. You
can change the region by using the region selector in the navigation
bar.

This stack takes approximately 5 minutes to create.

*Note* You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while
running this Quick Start reference deployment. There is no additional
cost for using this Quick Start. See the pricing pages for each AWS
service you will be using in this Quick Start for full details.

[arabic, start=4]
. On the *Select Template* page, keep the default setting for the Amazon
S3 template URL, and then choose *Next*.
. On the *Specify Details* page, review the following parameters for the
template, provide values for parameters that require your input, and
customize the default settings as necessary. For example, you can change
the network configuration parameters if you want to reconfigure the
subnet segmentation used for the VPC, as discussed earlier in the
link:#subnet_sizing[Subnet Sizing] section.

include::{includedir}/params.adoc[]

=== Step 3. Add AWS Services or Other Applications

After you use this Quick Start to build your VPC environment, you can
deploy additional Quick Starts or deploy your own applications on top of
this AWS infrastructure. If you decide to extend your AWS environment
with https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/[additional Quick Starts] for
trial or production use, we recommend that you choose the option to
deploy the Quick Start into an existing VPC, where that option is
available.

If you decide to deploy additional private subnets with dedicated
network ACLs, make sure you review the configuration and adjust it
accordingly. By default, the custom ACLs are configured to allow all
inbound and outbound traffic to flow in order to facilitate the
deployment of additional infrastructure. For more information, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_ACLs.html[Network
ACLs] and
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Appendix_NACLs.html[Recommended
Network ACL Rules for Your VPC] in the Amazon VPC documentation.

== Troubleshooting

When you deploy this Quick Start, if you encounter a *CREATE_FAILED*
error instead of the *CREATE_COMPLETE* status code, we recommend that
you relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *No*. (This
setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console, *Options*
page.) With this setting, the stack’s state will be retained and the
instance will be left running, so you can troubleshoot the issue.
(You’ll want to look at the log files in
%ProgramFiles%\Amazon\EC2ConfigService and in the C:\cfn\log folder.)

____
*Important* When you set *Rollback on failure* to *No*, you’ll continue
to incur AWS charges for this stack. Please make sure to delete the
stack when you’ve finished troubleshooting.
____

The following table lists specific *CREATE_FAILED* error messages you
might encounter.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Error message |Possible cause |What to do
|API: ec2: RunInstances Not authorized for images:

We refresh AMIs on a regular basis, but our schedule isn’t always
synchronized with AWS AMI updates. If you get this error message, notify
us, and we’ll update the template with the new AMI ID.

If you’d like to fix the template yourself, you can
https://fwd.aws/px53q[download it] and update the Mappings section with
the latest AMI ID for your region.

form] in the AWS Support Center.
|===

If you encounter a template validation error during deployment, check
for a mismatch in the values of the *Availability Zones* and *Number of
Availability Zones* parameters. If you select more Availability Zones
than you request, the AWS CloudFormation template won’t validate.
Correct the parameters so that they’re in sync, and redeploy the Quick
Start.

For additional information, see
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting
AWS CloudFormation] on the AWS website. If the problem you encounter
isn’t covered on that page or in the table, please visit the
https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/[AWS Support Center]. If you’re
filing a support ticket, please attach the install.log file from the
master instance (this is the log file that is located in the
/root/install folder) to the ticket.

== Security

=== Public and Private Subnets

This Quick Start provisions one public and one private subnet in each
Availability Zone by default. You can also choose to add additional
private subnets with dedicated network ACLs.

A public subnet is directly routable to the Internet via a route in the
route table that points to the Internet gateway. This type of subnet
allows the use of Elastic IPs and public IPs, and (if the security group
and network ACLs permit) a public subnet is reachable from the Internet.
A public subnet is useful as a DMZ infrastructure for web servers and
for Internet-facing Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancers.

Private subnets can indirectly route to the Internet via a NAT instance
or NAT gateway. These NAT devices reside in a public subnet in order to
route directly to the Internet. Instances in a private subnet are not
externally reachable from outside the Amazon VPC, regardless of whether
they have a public or Elastic IP address attached. A private subnet is
useful for application servers and databases.

=== Using Security Groups and Network ACLs

The following table (reprinted here from the AWS documentation for
convenience) describes the differences between security groups and
network ACLs:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Security group |Network ACL
|Operates at the instance level (first layer of defense) |Operates at
the subnet level (second layer of defense)

|Supports allow rules only |Supports allow rules and deny rules

|Is stateful: Return traffic is automatically allowed, regardless of any
rules |Is stateless: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules

|We evaluate all rules before deciding whether to allow traffic |We
process rules in numerical order when deciding whether to allow traffic

|Applies to an instance only if someone specifies the security group
when launching the instance, or associates the security group with the
instance later on |Automatically applies to all instances in the subnets
it's associated with (backup layer of defense, so you don't have to rely
on someone specifying the security group)
|===

The network ACLs in this Quick Start are configured as follows:

* All public and private subnets are associated with the same default
network ACL, which is automatically created for all VPCs on AWS. This
network ACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic. As you deploy
instances and services, you should associate them with security groups
and allow only the traffic and ports needed for your application.
* Each additional private subnet is associated with a custom network ACL
(1:1 ratio). These network ACLs are initially configured to allow all
inbound and outbound traffic to facilitate the deployment of additional
instances and services. As with the other subnets, you should use
security groups to secure the environment internally, and you can lock
down the custom network ACLs during or after deployment as required by
your application.

If the Quick Start deploys NAT instances instead of NAT gateways in the
AWS Region you selected, it adds a single security group as a virtual
firewall. This security group is required for NAT instances and any
other instances in the private subnets to access the Internet. The
security group is configured as follows:

Inbound:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Source |Protocol |Ports
|VPC CIDR |All |All
|===

Outbound:

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Destination |Protocol |Ports
|0.0.0.0/0 |All |All
|===

For additional details, see
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Security.html[Security
in Your VPC] in the Amazon VPC documentation.
